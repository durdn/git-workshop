git workshop

I have 15 years of experience in our industry, mainly in development of backend systems, web applications, ATG.
I started using git in a real private project in May 2008

more recently I've been fulfilling the role of branch manager (not release manager) at Delixl during the big production rollout. Using git svn.

Caveats: 
- I use the command line, I would not talk at all about existing graphical clients for win/osx or plugins for Eclipse, though they exist.
- I don't know much about tfs, clearcase, perforce etc...

A hands on demo on the basic workflow with git
--------------------------------------------------------
git commands
- basic flow: clone, pull, code, push
- proper flow with feature branch: clone, pull, feature branch, rebase branch, merge master, push
- reset and reset hard
  discarding local changes
  discarding commits in the local branch
  travel back in time with reset --hard
